## Original GitHub Body

## Background

From [background-agents.com](https://background-agents.com/): Updating one repository is a coding agent task. Updating
500 is a fleet task. The same sandbox, replicated across every repository — parallel provisioning, progress tracking,
aggregated results.

## Motivation

Routa currently operates on a single workspace per session. In organizations with many repositories, the same change (
e.g., upgrade a shared library, enforce a lint rule, apply a security patch) must be applied across many repos. There is
no fleet-level coordination today.

## Proposed Solution

A Fleet dispatch system:

- **Fleet API**: `POST /api/fleet` with `{ task_prompt, workspace_ids[] }`
- **Fleet record** in DB: masters over multiple agent runs, tracks per-repo status
- **Parallel execution**: spawn independent ACP sessions per workspace, all running the same prompt
- **Aggregated results UI**: fleet dashboard showing per-repo status (in-progress / success / failed) and PR links
- **Fleet from workspace UI**: a multi-select workspace picker + prompt → dispatch

## Use Cases

- Apply a security patch to all repos that use a vulnerable dependency
- Enforce a new ESLint rule across all frontend repositories
- Migrate CI config from CircleCI to GitHub Actions across 50 repos
