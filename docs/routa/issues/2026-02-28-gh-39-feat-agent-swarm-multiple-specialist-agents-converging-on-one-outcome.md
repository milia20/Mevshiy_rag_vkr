## Original GitHub Body

## Background

From [background-agents.com](https://background-agents.com/): Many agents, one outcome. Every agent works on a different
facet, and results converge into a single deliverable.

## Motivation

Routa already has an orchestrator that can delegate to specialist agents (see `src/core/orchestration/`). However,
specialists currently run sequentially within one session. There is no mechanism to run multiple independent specialist
agents in parallel and then merge their results.

## Proposed Solution

Extend the Orchestrator to support a swarm execution mode:

- **Swarm plan**: the orchestrator analyses the task and decomposes it into parallel sub-tasks, each assigned to a
  specialist
- **Parallel ACP sessions**: each sub-task gets its own ACP session running concurrently
- **Result aggregation**: once all specialists complete (or timeout), a synthesis agent merges outputs into a final
  result
- **Progress events**: stream per-specialist status through the existing event bridge

### Example swarm decomposition

Task: "Migrate authentication from JWT to Paseto"

- Specialist A: update auth library in `src/auth`
- Specialist B: update middleware and guards
- Specialist C: update tests
- Specialist D: update documentation
- Synthesizer: review diffs and create a single PR from all branches
