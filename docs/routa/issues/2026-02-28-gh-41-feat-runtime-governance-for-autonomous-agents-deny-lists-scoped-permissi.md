## Original GitHub Body

## Background

From [background-agents.com](https://background-agents.com/): Agents are actors in your system. They need the same
controls as human contributors — identity, permissions, audit trails. Governance enforced by a system prompt is a
suggestion; governance enforced at the execution layer is actual governance.

## Motivation

As Routa moves toward autonomous background agents (scheduled, webhook-triggered, fleet), security becomes critical.
Currently there are no runtime-enforced restrictions on what an agent can do. Security teams require deny lists, scoped
credentials, and audit trails before approving autonomous agent deployments.

## Proposed Solution

A governance layer wrapping each ACP agent execution:

### 1. Deny lists

- Configurable per workspace: blocked commands, blocked file paths, blocked external domains
- Enforced at the tool-call level (before MCP tools are invoked)
- Example: agents in prod-adjacent workspaces cannot run `rm -rf`, cannot push directly to `main`

### 2. Scoped credentials

- Each agent run receives only the secrets it explicitly needs (not all workspace secrets)
- Secret scoping defined in the trigger config or fleet spec

### 3. Audit trail

- Every tool call (file write, shell command, git push) logged to the existing `traces` table with agent identity +
  timestamp
- New UI view: per-workspace governance audit log
- Alerting on policy violations

### 4. Agent identity

- Each background agent run has a `run_id` and `triggered_by` (schedule / webhook / user) surfaced in the UI
