# Review pipeline lacks graph context and per-validator model control

## What happened

The current review analyze pipeline uses git diff plus a small set of config snippets as the main review payload. It
does not include graph-derived impact/test-radius review context that already exists in `entrix graph review-context`.

The same model override is applied uniformly across all review workers (`context`, `candidates`, `validator`). There is
no way to force only the validator phase to use a specific Claude model for targeted false-positive filtering tests.

## Why it matters

- Diff-only context weakens review quality on cross-module changes and increases missed dependencies.
- Validator quality is the highest leverage stage for precision. Without per-phase model control, it is hard to run
  controlled experiments (for example, validator-on-Claude while keeping earlier phases unchanged).
- Missing these controls slows down quality iteration and weakens trust in review output signal-to-noise.

## Resolution notes

- Added `graphReviewContext` / `graph_review_context` payload injection by invoking
  `entrix graph review-context --base <base> --json` in:
    - Next.js review pipeline
    - Rust review API
    - Rust CLI review analyze payload builder
- Added per-validator model override support:
    - Web API request field: `validatorModel`
    - Rust API request field: `validator_model` (camelCase JSON: `validatorModel`)
    - CLI flag: `--validator-model` (with shared `--model` fallback for other workers)
- Verified by targeted tests and build checks; GitHub issue #227 closed.
